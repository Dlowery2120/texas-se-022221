1. Copy this repo to your local
2. 'cd' into the repo from terminal, and run 'code .' to open on vscode
3. When I update this repo, you can open:
      this repo on vscode, 
      open terminal and in the root directory of the repo
      run 'git pull' to get new materials 
4. git and git flow and working with GitHub is weird, give t time you'll get the hang of it!
