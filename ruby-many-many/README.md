# Many to Many Relationships

## Takeways from yesterday's lecture: 
    *Objects can be passed into initialize methods to relate to other objects
    *We can call another Class from a method in another Class
    *We can take advantage of our Class variables to create dynamic methods
    *We set up the example of one-many relationships to model Artists and Songs

> **Note:** This is a separate relationship from the one to many that we built before. That 


## Objectives
        Implement both sides of a many to many relationship
        Practice keeping groups of data related to classes on the class as a class variable
        Demonstrate single source of truth by not storing collections of objects on other objects
